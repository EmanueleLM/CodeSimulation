<cot>The following lists of nodes @nodes@ and edges @edges@ define a graph. Each element in the list of edges is expressed in the form (i,j), and specifies that node i is connected to node j.
Is node @j@ reachable from node @j@?
Think step by step and then reply with true or false.

<kshot-cot>The following lists of nodes @example-nodes1@ and edges @example-edges1@ define a graph. Each element in the list of edges is expressed in the form (i,j), and specifies that node i is connected with node j.
Node @example-i1@ and @example-j1@ is @example-connected-1@ to @vtrace-value1@. This is how it is computed: 
@trace1@

Another example: for the lists of nodes @example-nodes2@ and edges @example-edges2@, node @example-i2@ is @example-connected-2@ to node @example-j2@. 
This is how it is computed: 
@trace2@

Another example: for the lists of nodes @example-nodes3@ and edges @example-edges3@, node @example-i3@ is @example-connected-3@ to node @example-j3@. 
This is how it is computed: 
@trace3@

Now, consider the following lists of nodes @nodes@ and edges @edges@: is node @i@ connected to node @j@?
Think step by step and then reply true or false.

Is node @j@ reachable from node @j@?
In particular:
# 1. Simulate the reachability algorithm and report the solution at the end of each iteration.
# 2. Think step by step and reply, at the end of the computation, with either true or false.
