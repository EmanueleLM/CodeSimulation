```
for _ in range(n):
    n_2 -= 2
```
This will be executed 3 times, so:
```
n_2 = -6
```
Finally, the function returns the sum of `n_0`, `n_1`, and `n_2`:
```
return sum([n_0, n_1, n_2])
= sum([7, 9, -6])
= 10
```
So, the output of the function for `n=3` is:
<result>10</result>

Now, let's go through the inner loops:

**First inner loop (n=3):**
```
n_1 += -1  # n_1 = 0
n_1 += -1  # n_1 = -1
n_1 += -1  # n_1 = -2

Let's simulate the program instruction by instruction.

**Initial values:**

**Trace:** n_0 = 2, n_1 = 0, n_2 = 1, n_3 = -1, n_4 = -1, n_5 = 1, n_6 = 0

**First iteration of second loop:**
n_1 -= 2 => n_1 = -2
**Trace:** n_0 = 2, n_1 = -2, n_2 = 1, n_3 = -1, n_4 = -1, n_5 = 1, n_6 = 0

**First iteration of third loop:**
n_2 -= 2 => n_2 = -1
**Trace:** n_0 = 2, n_1 = -2, n_2 = -1, n_3 = -1, n_4 = -1, n_5 = 1, n_6 = 0

**First iteration of fourth loop:**
n_3 *= -1 => n_3 = 1
**Trace:** n_0 = 2, n_1 = -2, n_2 = -1, n_3 = 1, n_4 = -1, n_5 = 1, n_6 = 0

**First iteration of fifth loop:**
n_4 += 2 => n_4 = 1
**Trace:** n_0 = 2, n_1 = -2, n_2 = -1, n_3 = 1, n_4 = 1, n_5 = 1, n_6 = 0

**First iteration of sixth loop:**

**Trace:** n_0 = 2, n_1 = -2, n_2 = -1, n_3 = 1, n_4 = 1, n_5 = 3, n_6 = 0

**First iteration of seventh loop:**

**Trace:** n_0 = 2, n_1 = -2, n_2 = -1, n_3 = 1, n_4 = 1, n_5 = 3, n_6 = 0

**Repeat the process for the remaining iterations...**

After 3 iterations of the outer loop, the final values are:

n_0 += 1 => n_0 = 1
_for _ in range(n):_ (1st iteration)
n_1 += -1 => n_1 = -2

**Iteration 2:**

n_1 += -1 => n_1 = -4
_for _ in range(n):_ (3rd iteration)

_for _ in range(n):_ (3rd iteration)
n_3 += 1 => n_3 = 4
_for _ in range(n):_ (3rd iteration)
n_4 += 2 => n_4 = 6

n_6 += 1 => n_6 = 2
_for _ in range(n):_ (3rd iteration)
n_7 += 2 => n_7 = 5
_for _ in range(n):_ (3rd iteration)
n_8 *= -1 => n_8 = 1

**Final trace:**
n_0 = 3, n_1 = -4, n_2 = 7, n_3 = 4, n_4 = 6, n_5 = 2, n_6 = 2, n_7 = 5, n_8 = 1

**Final values:**
n_0 = -1, n_1 = -2, n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1, n_4 = -1, n_5 = 0, n_6 = 0, n_7 = 0, n_8 = 1

**Return value:**
The function returns the sum of the final values: -1 - 2 + 1 + 1 - 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = -1
