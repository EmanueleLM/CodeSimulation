In particular:
# 1. Simulate the programs instruction by instruction.
# 2. Report the trace of each program at the end of each iteration.
# 3. Think step by step and demonstrate that the Python functions return the same result for n=@input@. Report the result between <result></result> tags, so for example <result>[2, -3]</result>.
