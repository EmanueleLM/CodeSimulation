<cot>The following lists of nodes @nodes@ and edges @edges@ define a graph. Each element in the list of edges is expressed in the form (i,j,w), and specifies that node i is connected to node j with weight w.

What is the value of the max flow from node @i@ to node @j@?
Think step by step and then reply with the numerical value of the max flow.

<kshot-cot>The following lists of nodes @example-nodes1@ and edges @example-edges1@ define a graph. Each element in the list of edges is expressed in the form (i,j,w), and specifies that node i is connected with node j with weight w.

The max flow between node @example-i1@ and @example-j1@ is @vtrace-value1@. This is how it is computed: 
@trace1@

Another example: for the lists of nodes @example-nodes2@ and edges @example-edges2@, the max flow between node @example-i2@ and @example-j2@ is @vtrace-value2@. This is how it is computed: 
@trace2@

Another example: for the lists of nodes @example-nodes3@ and edges @example-edges3@, the max flow between node @example-i3@ and @example-j3@ is @vtrace-value3@. This is how it is computed: 
@trace3@

Now, consider the following lists of nodes @nodes@ and edges @edges@: what is the max flow path from node @i@ to node @j@?
Think step by step and then reply with the numerical value of the max flow.

What is the value of the max flow from node @i@ to node @j@?

In particular:
# 1. Simulate the max flow and report the solution at the end of each iteration.
# 2. Think step by step and reply with the value of the max flow from node @i@ to node @j@.
