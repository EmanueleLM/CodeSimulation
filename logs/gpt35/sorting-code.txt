1. Simulate the program instruction by instruction:

- Initialize n as the length of the array (10).
- Start the outer loop with i = 0.
- Set min_index as i (0).
- Start the inner loop with j = i + 1 (1).
- Check if array[j] (7) is less than array[min_index] (16). It is, so update min_index to j (1).
