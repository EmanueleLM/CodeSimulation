<cot>Simulate this Python code.
@code@

Think step by step and then reply with the correct result for the following input value @input@.
</cot>

<kshot-cot>@illustration@

Now, for the input value @input@, think step by step and simulate the Python function. Then then reply with the correct result.
</kshot-cot>

<code>Provide a step-by-step simulation of this Python code.
@code@

Think step by step and then reply, for the input value @input@, with the correct output of the code. In particular:
# 1. Provide a step-by-step simulation.
# 2. Report the trace of the program at the end of each iteration.
# 3. Think step by step and then reply with the correct result for input the input value @input@. Report the result between <result></result> tags, so for example <result>[5, 7, 9]</result>.

Think step by step and then reply with the correct result for input the input value @input@. In particular:
# 1. Simulate the program instruction by instruction.
# 2. Report the trace of the program at the end of each instruction.
# 3. Think step by step and reply with the correct result for input the input value @input@ at the end of the computation. Report the result between <result></result> tags, so for example <result>[5, 7, 9]</result>.
