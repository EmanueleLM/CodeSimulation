<cot>Find, in the following vector of numbers, the largest odd number followed by an even number. 
@input@
If the last element is odd, you can assume an even number follows it. 
If there are no odd numbers in the array, return -1.
Think step by step and reply with the correct result. Report the result between <result></result> tags, so for example <result>1</result>.

Now, consider the following input vector:
@input@
Find the largest odd number followed by an even number.
If the last element is odd, you can assume an even number follows it. 
If there are no odd numbers in the array, return -1.
Think step by step and reply with the correct result. Report the result between <result></result> tags, so for example <result>1</result>.

If there are no odd numbers in the array, return -1.
In particular:
# 1. Simulate, instruction by instruction, a program that solves the problem.
# 2. Report the trace of the execution at the end of each iteration. Report the result between <result></result> tags, so for example <result>1</result>.
