<cot>Simulate this Python code.
@code@
Think step by step and then reply with the output of the function for n=@input@.
<\cot>

<kshot-cot>Consider the following Python programs: 
@example1@
The expected trace of the program looks like this: 
@trace1@
The expected output at the end of the computation is @vtrace-value1@.

Another example:
@example2@
The expected trace of the program looks like this:
@trace2@
The expected output at the end of the computation is @vtrace-value2@.

Another example:
@example3@
The expected trace of the program looks like this: 
@trace3@
The expected output at the end of the computation is @vtrace-value3@.

Now, simulate this Python code.

In particular:
# 1. Simulate the program instruction by instruction.
# 2. Report the trace of the program at the end of each iteration.
# 3. Think step by step and then reply with the output of the function for n=@input@.
