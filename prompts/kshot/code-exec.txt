Consider a Python program that can contain sums, assignments and logical operations.
A sum has the form a += b, which means that a becomes equal to its value plus that of b. A subtraction, in the form a -= b, works with the same rationale.
An assignment has the form a = b, which means that a becomes equal to b.
A logical and has the form a &= b, which means that a becomes equal to the logical and of a and b. A logical or, in the form a |= b, works with the same rationale.

Here's an example of a program that consists of 5 instructions, including assignments.
a0=5; a1=3; a2=8
a0 -= a1
a0 = a1
a4 += a1
a0 -= a2

The computation carried on is the following:
1. a0=5; a1=3; a2=8; a3=0; a4=4
2. a0 -= a1 -> a0 = 5 - 3 = 2
3. a0 = a1 -> a0 = 3
4. a4 += a1 -> a4 = 4 + 3 = 7
5. a0 -= a2 -> a0 = 3 - 8 = -5

So, for example, the value of a4 at the end of the iterations is 7 while the value of a0 is -5.
